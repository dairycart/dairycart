There are two primary ways to help:

- Using the issue tracker, and
- Changing the code-base.

Contributions to this project that do not adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) will be rejected.

## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.

## Changing the code-base

NOTE: I'm in the process of building the API, so there are lots of features that are missing as of right now.
I'd greatly prefer if you'd allow me some time to address those shortcomings before issuing contributions. Thank you.

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request. All new code should have associated unit
tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.

A big thanks to the [CFPB](https://github.com/cfpb/open-source-project-template) for the template this file is based on.
